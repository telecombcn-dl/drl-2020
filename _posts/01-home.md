### UPC ETSETB TelecomBCN (Autumn 2020)

This course presents the principles of reinforcement learning as an artificial intelligence tool based on the interaction of the machine with its environment, with applications to control tasks (eg. robotics, autonomous driving) o decision making (eg. resource optimization in wireless communication networks).
It also advances in the development of deep neural networks trained with little or no supervision, both for discriminative and generative tasks, with special attention on multimedia applications (vision, language and speech).
